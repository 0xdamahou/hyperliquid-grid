# Hyperliquid Grid Project Introduction

**Hyperliquid Grid** is an automated trading system designed for cryptocurrency grid trading on [Hyperliquid.xyz](https://hyperliquid.xyz). Conducting futures trading on Hyperliquid offers the following three key advantages:

1. **Superior Fee Structure**: The maker fee is only **0.001%**, half of what Binance charges, while Hyperliquid maintains excellent liquidity.
2. **Potential Airdrop Opportunities**: At the end of 2024, Hyperliquid’s airdrop was one of the most generous projects of the year.
3. **Transparent Blockchain Trading**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, fully traceable and verifiable, avoiding the frequent “pinning” liquidations that occur on centralized exchanges (CEX) in the middle of the night.

**Hyperliquid Grid** is a complete trading system that I have personally been running at low leverage for a considerable amount of time. However, *no system can guarantee profits*.

If you find this system helpful to your profitability, you can use my referral code ([**DAMAHOU**](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/DAMAHOU)) on Hyperliquid. By doing so, you’ll receive an additional **4% discount** on trading fees, and I’ll earn a **10% referral fee commission**.

For instructions on how to use this system, please refer to the [`How-to-use.md`](./How-to-use.md) file.

Wishing you the best of luck in striking it rich!
